/**
 * This interface is a subset of the java.util.List interface and does not
 * require implementation of generic parameterization.
 * 
 * This interface is adapted from java.util.List.
 * 
 * @author David R. Wright
 *
 *
 *         An ordered collection (also known as a sequence). The user of this
 *         interface has precise control over where in the list each element is
 *         inserted. The user can access elements by their integer index
 *         (position in the list), and search for elements in the list.
 *
 *         The List interface provides four methods for positional (indexed)
 *         access to list elements. Lists (like Java arrays) are zero based.
 *         Note that these operations may execute in time proportional to the
 *         index value for some implementations (the LinkedList class, for
 *         example). Thus, iterating over the elements in a list is typically
 *         preferable to indexing through it if the caller does not know the
 *         implementation.
 *
 *         Note: While it is permissible for lists to contain themselves as
 *         elements, extreme caution is advised: the equals and hashCode methods
 *         are no longer well defined on such a list.
 *
 *         Some list implementations have restrictions on the elements that they
 *         may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null
 *         elements, and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.
 *         Attempting to add an ineligible element throws an unchecked
 *         exception, typically NullPointerException or ClassCastException.
 *         Attempting to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw
 *         an exception, or it may simply return false; some implementations
 *         will exhibit the former behavior and some will exhibit the latter.
 *         More generally, attempting an operation on an ineligible element
 *         whose completion would not result in the insertion of an ineligible
 *         element into the list may throw an exception or it may succeed, at
 *         the option of the implementation. Such exceptions are marked as
 *         "optional" in the specification for this interface.
